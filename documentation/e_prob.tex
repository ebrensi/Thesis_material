In a calculus course I TA'd once I noticed a very common mistake was to carry a derivative into the operand of a $\log$ function, like for $x(t)$,
\begin{equation}
(\ln x)^\prime = \ln x^\prime \tag{*}
\label{eq:problem}
\end{equation}

I thought it would make an interesting problem to find such an $x(t)$ for which \eqref{eq:problem} holds.
