\begin{abstract}
The major contribution of this thesis is a new  thick-restarted Krylov method that allows for re-starting the process at different interpolation-points while preserving moment-matching and providing a controllable degree of linear-dependence of the resulting basis.   It reduces computational-cost by recycling a controllable number of vectors per cycle.  The algorithms comprising the method are outlined and their efficiency is demonstrated by applying it to selected test-models.
