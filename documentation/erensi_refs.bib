  abstract = {Modeling of large scale systems is a numerically costly and time consuming
	procedure. Model Order Reduction techniques seek to replace such
	large scale systems by considerably smaller ones while preserving
	the input-output dynamics. Krylov-subspace based reduction techniques
	are numerically efficient techniques for reducing very large systems
	with orders ranging from tens of thousands to millions. However,
	one of the disadvantages with these techniques is that there is no
	stopping criterion to automatically select a suitable order for the
	reduced system. This paper presents an efficient stopping criterion
	which can be embedded in the iterative algorithms used conventionally
	for generating the ortho-normal basis for the Krylov subspace.},
