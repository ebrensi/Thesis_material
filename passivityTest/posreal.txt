I focused on implementing tests for posititve realness of the transfer function during fall/winter 2008-2009. 
I found them difficult to implement due to numerical problems, but it turned out that some of the given 
data examples were incorrect as well, so it may be that my implementation was better than I thought.  The point 
of these tests was to determine by experiment if the reduced models generated by the hessenberg formulation retain
passivity.  It appears not to be the case.
 
These routines may still be useful at some point but for now I am shelving this work.
